It has limited functionality but will\ngive you a sense of what to expect from the full version. You can download the free version \nhere\n.\n\n\nHere is a guide to get you started with the lite version of Alex's Door System!\n\n\nInstallation and Setup\n\n\nFirst of all, import the asset into your project. The asset will create a folder 'Ameye' under your Assets directory.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you've imported the asset, you'll need to create the tag 'Door'. You can simply do this by doing\nTools>Alex's Door System>Create Door tag. Alternatively you could manually create the tag by doing Edit>Project Settings>Tags and Layers.\n\n\nBasic Setup\n\n\nNow that we're done setting up the asset, we can actually start creating some doors!\nWe will first create a player in our scene. Make sure that the player can move around and look around\nin your scene. If you want to, you can use the player prefab that is included in the asset. Notice that the\nplayer has the detection component attached to it.\nIf you are using your own player controller, make sure to add this detection component as well.\nIn the inspector of the detection component, make sure that the reach variable is set to 5 and the character variable is set to \"E\".\n\n\n\n\nNow our player is done and we can start creating a door! Just create a basic door shape out of a default cube and place it in your scene.\nAfter you have created a door that you're happy with, add the door component to it.\nTake a look at the door component. Let's set the initial angle to 0, the final angle to 90, and the speed to 2.\n\n\n\n\nWe've set up everything needed so let's hit play! As expected we can enter the blue trigger zone, and when we press 'E',\nthe door will rotate 90 degrees with a speed of 2 (duration of 0.5 seconds).\n\n\nDetection Component\n\n\nThe detection component allows the player to detect doors in your scene. It ray-casts continuously and checks what objects are in front of him/her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReach\n\n\nWithin this radius, the player is able to open/close the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\nThe character that the player has to press in order to open/close the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Prefab\n\n\nThe text that will be displayed when the player is looking at a door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrosshair Prefab\n\n\nThe crosshair that will be displayed at the center of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebug Ray Color\n\n\nThe color of the line shown in scene-view that represents the ray-cast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpacity\n\n\nThe opacity of the debug-ray.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nMake sure the 'Reach' variable is not set to zero.'.\n\n\n\n\nDoor Component\n\n\nThe door component manages the actual rotation of the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Angle\n\n\nThe initial angle of the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotation Angle\n\n\nThe amount of degrees the door will rotate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotation Side\n\n\nWhether the door should rotate left or right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\nThe speed of the rotation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimes Moveable\n\n\nHow many times the door will be able to move. If set to zero, the door will be able to rotate an infinite amount of times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHinge Type\n\n\nWhether the rotation axis of the door is centered or already correctly positioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHinge Position\n\n\nThe position of the hinge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualize Hinge\n\n\nWhether or not the hinge should be visualized in the game for debugging purposed or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHinge Color\n\n\nThe color of the visualization of the hinge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrectly Positioned or Centered?\n\n\nIn the door script you have the option to select whether or not the rotation axis of the door is already correctly positioned.\nTo check what you need to select, make sure to select pivot instead of center.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you've done that, take a look at your door. If the pivot handle is centered, select \"centered\" in your door script. If\nthe pivot handle is where the hinge should be, select \"Correctly Positioned\".\n\n\nChanging the text prefabs?\n\n\nSelect the text prefab in your project that you'd like to change. Click and drag it onto your hierarchy. Click on the prefab\nin the hierarchy window and unfold it to select 'Text 1'.\n\n\nSelect 'Text 1'.\n\n\n\n\nGo to you inspector window and change the settings to your liking. You can change the text, font,...\n\n\n\n\nAfter you've completed the changes you wanted to make, re-assign it to the prefab by clicking and dragging the object 'TextPrefab' in the\nhierarchy window back onto the prefab in your project window. After this, remove the prefab element that's still\nin the hierarchy window.\n\n\nThe same can be done for the 'Crosshair' prefab.\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nThe lite version has some limitations compared to the pro version.
